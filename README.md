# Estudio Poblacional Multinivel de las Desigualdades Socioeconómicas en la Distribución Geográfica de la Incidencia, la Mortalidad y la Supervivencia Neta del Cáncer en España  

## Proyecto DESOCANES (FIS PI18/01593)

# Abstract
The incidence of cancer is increasing worldwide due mainly to the ageing of the population. Population-based cancer registries are an essential public health resource for epidemiological surveillance and cancer control. Incidence and mortality provide information on the burden of cancer morbidity and the potential years of life lost due to cancer, while survival is a general indicator of the effectiveness of the health system. In northern European countries there is a long tradition of using indices of deprivation to characterize socioeconomic inequalities at a geographical level. In the United Kingdom cancer patients living in wealthier areas have a higher cancer survival than those living in more disadvantaged areas. However, in Spain there is not supporting evidence showing socioeconomic inequalities in cancer outcomes. It is for this reason that the European Index of Deprivation (EDI) has recently been developed as a standardized measure to measure socio-economic deprivation in southern Europe at the census level. In addition, it is possible to combine EDI information with ecological variables at the population level and data from the European Studies of High Resolution in Cancer. The main objective of this project is to characterize socioeconomic inequalities in incidence, excess mortality, premature mortality and net survival for three of the most incidental cancers (lung, colon-rectum and breast) using a specific deprivation index for Spain and for three of the most incident cancer sites (breast, lung and colorectal). We will develop a national population-based study to assess the impact of socioeconomic inequalities on cancer, using state-of-the-art epidemiological methods that include spatial analysis, multilevel modeling, net survival, and an economic impact assessment. The identification and characterization of cancer socioeconomic inequalities and the associated determinants in Spain could have important implications for the organization and the provision of services in cancer medical care, minimizing the impact of the cancer "epidemic" in Spain.
